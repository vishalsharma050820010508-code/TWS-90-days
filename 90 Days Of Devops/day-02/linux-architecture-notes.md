- **Hardware**
    - The physical component where OS is installed.
- **Kernal**
    - Heart of Linux OS
    - The central core that directly controls hardware, processes, memory. Interface between hardware and software.
- **User Space**
    - Where normal application software and services run in background
    - where applications and the shell execute
- **Init / systemd**
    -  First process started by the kernel 
    -  manage hardware, network connections, user authentication, and system performance

## systemd Overview
- systemd is the init system used by most modern Linux systems
  - Its PID is 01
  - Starting services at boot
  - Restarting failed services
     

## Whats Process in Linux 
- A running program in instance is a Process
- Every Process can recognize by its PID

### Process States
- Running   : Active Process
- Sleeping  : process is waiting for input  
- Stopped   : suspended  process
- Zombie    :  Process finished but parent process hasn't read its exit status yet

# 5 Commands used daily 
- `ps`   : View running processes
- `systemctl`  : To start or stop or to view status of any service
- `man`  : To check manual of any command
- `vim`   : Editor to edit any file
- `free -m`    : To check memory usage

## Why This Matters
- For troubleshooting Linux
- Helps debug crashed services
- To identify CPU or memory issues
